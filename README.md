# Neural
**Note:** Neural currently a WIP
Neural is a simple C++ framework
## What does it currently support?
### Languages
 - C++
 - [C#, VB.NET and C++/CLI](https://github.com/PatrickShaw/neural)
### Supervised Training
 - [Standard backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)
 - Topology trainer: Automatically configure your neural network's layout given a set of training and test data.
### Activation 
 - [Sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)
## // TODO
 - Add the [Resilient backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rprop) aglorithm and it's derivatives.
 - [Long short-term neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
 - [Convulution networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
